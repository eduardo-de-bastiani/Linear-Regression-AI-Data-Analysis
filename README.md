# Data-Analysis-and-Prediction
## Project Overview

### This project involves analyzing data from three .ods files, merging relevant information into a consolidated file called pedidosatualizados.ods, and creating a predictive model using linear regression. The analysis and model were developed in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Features

- Data Analysis: Import and clean data from .ods files.
- Data Merging: Combine information from multiple files into a single dataset.
- Data Visualization: Generate various plots to understand data trends and patterns.
- Predictive Modeling: Build a linear regression model to make predictions based on the consolidated data.



## Results
### Data Analysis

- Imported and cleaned data from three .ods files.
- Merged relevant information into Pedidos_Atualizados.ods.
- Visualized the data using histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.

### Predictive Modeling

- Developed a linear regression model using pedidosatualizados.ods.
- Evaluated the model's performance.
- Made predictions based on new data.
